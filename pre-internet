        Evidence of attempts at motion in graphics can be seen all the way back to
        5,000 years ago. For example, above is a series of paintings found on a
        vase in Shahr-i Sokhta, in Iran. It depicts a goat climbing a tree to
        eat leaves and coming back down and is believed to be about 4,500 years
        old.

      This is a cave painting found in the cave of Almtamira, in Spain. It's
      believed that cave paintings like this were intended to be animated by a
      flickering fire or passing a torch. In this case, the illusion of motion
      likely would have been achieved by illuminating different parts of the
      painting.

    <p3>
      Another early attempt was the use of shadows to create the illusion of
      motion. Old texts suggest it originated in China or India but there is
      also a history of shadow play in Europe using hand puppets.

      The Magic Lantern was invented by Christiaan Huygens in 1659.
      This creates motion by using paintings on one or more pieces of glass
      which are then moved by hand or by a small mechanism across a stationary
      slide which showed the rest of the image. Following this, there were
      multiple different inventions used to create a similar effect in the 19th
      century and were likely based on this device. Such as the Thaumatrope in
      1825, the Zoetrope in 1833 and the praxinoscope in 1879.
