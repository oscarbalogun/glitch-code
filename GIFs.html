        Gifs (Graphics Interchange Format) were created by Steve Wilhite and his
        team at Compuserve in 1987, as a way to share colour image files without
        using up too much of a computers memory. Initially it was just used for
        still images but a compression algorithm, named Lempel-Ziv-Welch after
        its creators Abraham Lemepl, Jacob Ziv and Terry Welch, allowed the
        files to hold multiple variations of a still image which could be put
        together to create a looping video. The first animated GIF ever put on
        the internet was this plane but the first practical use of animated GIFs
        was weather maps.

      Another early use of animated GIFs, which is still often used today, is
      company logos. Companies would often enhance their logos by rotating them
      350Â° giving the illusion of 3D.

      After the introduction of GIFs animation on the web pretty much stayed
      the same for the next 10 years, until the introduction of
