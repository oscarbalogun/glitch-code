        <h3>CSS</h3>

        <p1>
          CSS or Cascading Style Sheets, first proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in
          1994 and released in 1996, is a stylesheet language that specifies the
          styling and presentation of a web document written in a markup
          language, often HTML, by creating rules that control how the content
          of an element should appear. This allows content and presentation to
          be formatted seperately, improving content accessibility and provides
          more control and flexibility.
        </p1>

        <p2>
          In terms of animation, CSS allows for very simple ones. The most
          common use is the tag, hover, which allows users to hover over an object and
          an animation will play, however these tend to be very simple
          transformations or a change in colour etc. Although CSS isn't great
          for complex animations, the simplicity of the animations it does allow
          for make them relatively easy to implement. In fact, it's the
          stylesheet language currently in use for this site.
        </p2>

        <br />
        <br />

        <p2>
          The simplicity of CSS means that it would usually be used for basic
          animations such as hover effects, transitions or small non-interactive
          animations. It is also the smoother and more efficient option, making
          it ideal for performance-critical situations. Finally, it's also good
          for making more responsive websites as it adapts to screen size.

      <h3>HTML</h3>

        HTML or HyperText Language Markup, created in 1980 by Tim Berners-Lee is
        a standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
        web broswer. It defines the structure and content of the webpage and
        will usually be paired with either CSS or Javascript for the styling and
        presentation. The first version of it was based on a software Lee
        created for CERN researchers to use and share documents. Documents are
        stored on a server or local storage and rendered in a web browser into
        multimedia webpages.

        >In 1995, however, the Internet Engineering Taskforce (IETF) developed
        HTML 2.0 which was the first standard intended to be the base of all
        future iterations. We have since got a number of improved versions and
        currently have HTML 5 as the most up to date version. For example the
        original didn't support audio or video without the use of Flash however
        it now has them integrated using the audio and video tags. HTML 5 also
        now stores data offline through SQL databases and application caches
        which the original cookie based system didn't allow for and much more.

      <p6>
        JavaScript, created in 1995 by Brendan Eich when Netscape hired him to
        combine the Java and Scheme languages to make a new language for their
        Navigator browser, is a powerful programming language that, when paired
        with HTML can perform a similar role to CSS. However, being more complex
        it can do a lot more. Due to this it's used more, 99% of websites use it
        for webpage behaviour on the client side.
      </p6>

      <br />
      <br />

      <p7>
        In terms of Animation, JavaScript can do a lot more than CSS. The most
        significant difference is that it allows for user interactions, for
        example, drag and drop functions. It also allows for real time updates
        meaning that animations can be synced with other parts of the webpage.
        However, it's much more resource intesive than CSS and the added
        complexity means it's not as accessible for those who are new to web
        design.
      </p7>

      <br />
      <br />

      <p8>
        The complexity of JavaScript makes it better for more intricate
        animations, maybe with dynamic effects as it provides more flixibility
        and control. Additionally, it would be essential when making interactive
        elements like charts and graphs for data driven animations.
