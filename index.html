        <p1>"The process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change
        by means of rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ
        from each other" <i>Wikipedia</i>.</p1>

        <p2>In short, it's when an artist puts
        images, traditionally hand drawn, one after another to make it seem as
        though the connected images are one moving piece. This can be used in a
        number of ways, such as; film, tv and video games, which is the form
        people are most familiar with, but also in motion graphics which are
        often used in marketing and creative arts and many other areas. But in
        relation to the internet, animation is used in so many things; GIFs,
        popups (i.e. transitioning from images to text or adding or removing
        items from a list), certain animations to guide users through an
        interface, animating a subject or object to help tell a story and much
        more...</p2>

        On the web, this is achieved through a number of different technologies and techniques. Click the links at the <a href="#top">top of the page</a> to learn more about some of these.
