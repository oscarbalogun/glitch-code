          In 1996 Adobe Flash was released. a multimedia software used for
          animation, internet and desktop applications and mobile apps and
          games. Unlike GIFs, Flash allowed for audio and video as well as input
          from mouse, keyboard, microphone and camera. This made it perfect for
          animation and web games.

      <h3>Flash Animation</h3>

      <p2>
        Adobe had multiple software that allowed creators to make all sorts of
        media on flash. For animation, for example, artists could use Adobe
        Flash Professional (now Adobe Animate) to make animations. It was even
        used to make a number of cartoons and animated films. The first being
        Ren and Stimpy created by John Kricfalusi and released in 1997, it was
        the first of many cartoons produced specifically for the internet.

      <p3>
        In 1999, David B Williams and his studio, Visionary media, released
        Whirlgirl. A cartoon about a super-heroine fighting for freedom against
        a futuristic mediatech empire. This was a big deal and a major milestone
        for Adobe Animations as it premiered on the cable channel, Showtime, and
        released at the same time on the showtime website, making it the first
        regularly scheduled Flash Animated series.
      </p3>

      <br />
      <br />

      <p4>
        Since then Flash Animation has been used for a number of different shows
        and feature films and Adobe Animate is even still used today for many
        animated films and tv shows.

    <h4>Decline of flash</h4>

    <p5>
      The birth of mobile meant that flash started to be used less and less on
      the web as the extensive cpu that flash files produced as they were
      processed drained the battery too fast for early mobile devices. Because
      of this apple decided not to support flash on any of their devices so
      developers eventually stopped using it and the internet went back to being
      static again (apart from GIFs) until the introduction of <a href="CSS.html">CSS</a>.
